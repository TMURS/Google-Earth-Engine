# Taipei Medical University Remote Sensing Data Center (TMU-RSDC)
TMU-RSDC provides python scripts to generate multiple environemtnal parameters dervied from different satellite remote sensing images on Goolge Earth Engine. At the curent stage, land surface temperature (LST), NDVI, and NDWI can be derived from MODIS, Landsat, or Sentinel-2. Precipitation is from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS). Global land cover/use at 2020 is acquired from WorldCover project. We also provided a wide set of meteorological variables derived from ECMWF ERA5 dataset. More detail information about these datasets can be found on the GEE Data Catalog. https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/
